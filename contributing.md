# Contribution Guidelines

> Please be aware that we want to accept your contribution, but we have **some rules to keep the minimum quality** of the packages listed here. All reviews are **not personal feedback**, even if you are a _developer reviewing your contribution_. **Sorry if we can't meet your expectations, we do our best**.
- **To add, remove, or change things on the list:** Submit a pull request




Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes packages fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or let us know. We also realize that sometimes projects are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature. These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days). This grace window benefits projects that may be going through a temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.



Note : You can add any piece of code or project, you want to share but do describe it while creating the pull request. (No need to describe its function, just include the question or name of the topic)
# Do not create invalid Pull requests.
